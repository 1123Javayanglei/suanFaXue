<P><h3>Name (editable)</h3></P>
<blockquote>
<P>Views the internal name of the project, which is only used for bookkeeping and the title bar.</P>
</blockquote>

<P><h3>Filename</h3></P>
<blockquote>
<P>Shows the location of the project file.</P>
</blockquote>

<P><h3>Output File</h3></P>
<blockquote>
<P>Shows the output location of the executable. This can be editted by Build Options >> Executable Output Directory and Override Output Filename.</P>
</blockquote>

<P><h3>Files</h3></P>
<blockquote>
<P>Shows the amount of files inside the project (.cpp/.h/.rc).</P>
</blockquote>

<P><h3>Icon</h3></P>
<blockquote>
	<P>Dev-C++ can add an Icon to the executable for you. By doing this, Dev-C++ will add 'A ICON MOVEABLE PURE LOADONCALL DISCARDABLE "filename.ico"' to a temporary resource file (projectname_private.rc) that is attached to the project at compile time.</P>

	<P><b>Library</b></P>
	<blockquote>
	<P>Opens up the \Icons folder which provides an antique set of ye-olde icons. One can of course add his own icons to that folder, so that they will show up here.</P>
	</blockquote>

	<P><b>Browse</b></P>
	<blockquote>
	<P>Opens up a File Browser to search through the file system for icon files.</P>
	</blockquote>

	<P><b>Remove</b></P>
	<blockquote>
	<P>Detaches the currently selected icon from the project. Does not delete the file itself. </P>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<P><h3>Type</h3></P>
<blockquote>
<P>Toggles a few compiler options. For example, by selecting 'Win32 GUI', Dev-C++ will add '-mwindows' to the GCC commandline, so that the application does not create a console window anymore.</P>
</blockquote>

<P><h3>Support Windows XP Themes</h3></P>
<blockquote>
<P>If enabled, Dev-C++ will add a Common Control 6 Manifest to the project. Dev-C++ will add '1 24 "Project1.exe.Manifest"' to a resource file (projectname_private.rc) coupled to the project at compile time. This enables Windows XP styles if available.</P>
