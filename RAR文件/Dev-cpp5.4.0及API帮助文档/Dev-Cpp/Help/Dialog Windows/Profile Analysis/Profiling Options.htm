<P>This is Dev-C++'s GUI wrapper around gprof.exe. All data shown here is generated by GPROF. Therefore, this is the perfect place for a generic GPROF tip. I configured it to show all function that are called. However, functions that are not used for more that 0.01 second are discarded whatsoever by GPROF. So, if you want to profile a really small application, please implement a looping system to make it run longer before opening this dialog.</h3></P>

<P><h3>Hide functions not called long enough.</h3></P>
<blockquote>
<P>Unticking this item effectively adds '-z' to GPROF's command line. This will force GPROF to print data about every single function inside the executable.</P>
</blockquote>

<P><h3>Suppress statically declared (private) functions.</h3></P>
<blockquote>
<P>As static functions do not belong to the globals, they are not visible outside the function or file they were defined in. Time spent in them can therefore not be attributed to these globally unknown functions. The actual time spent is added to the function called before it by GPROF. This option will exclude time spent in these functions from the generated data. This option enables the '-s' command.</P>
</blockquote>

<P><h3>Supress functions called less than x times</h3></P>
<blockquote>
<P>Exactly as the label tells you, function called less than X times will be omited. This options controls the '-m (value)' flag.</P>
</blockquote>

<P><h3>Use these commands instead:</h3></P>
<blockquote>
<P>If you check this, Dev-C++ will use the commands you enter below instead. These command will be editted to what Dev is currently using if you haven't checked this option.</P>
