<P>This is Dev-C++'s GUI wrapper around gprof.exe. All data shown here is generated by GPROF. Therefore, this is the perfect place for a generic GPROF tip. I configured it to show all function that are called. However, functions that are not used for more that 0.01 second are discarded whatsoever by GPROF. So, if you want to profile a really small application, please implement a looping system to make it run longer before opening this dialog.</h3></P>

<P><h3>Function List</h3></P>
<blockquote>
<P>Here is where the function output to stdout of bin\GPROF.exe gets placed. All data is directly placed here, Dev will not edit this in any way. This data is generated by the '"gprof -q "executablename"' command. This command will tell GPROF to examine the generated projectfolder\gmon.out file which contains the generated profiling data.</P>
</blockquote>

<P><h3>Explanation List</h3></P>
<blockquote>
<P>Here the explanation generated by gprof.exe itself is printed. This data is inserted into stdout by it if one does not specify the -b option.</P>
